        " Computer Science should be taught using latest technologies, internet and new hardware. Since computer technology  is developing day by day, teaching styles and materials should also be updated. Languages like python and java should also be taught in grade 9th. Teachers should be able to explain looping and other things in programming clearly, as all the students get the concept.\n",
        " It should undergo significant changes in this subject. Schools should embrace technology by allowing students to take laptops to school and encouraging practical projects that require online research and problem-solving. The curriculum should prioritize hands-on learning, enabling students to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios. Adding to it teachers should get training and resources to be with the current industries standards. Its the digital age so it is essential to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills in computer science education to prepare students effectively for it.\n",
        " \"I would like to suggest the following improvements:\n",
        " Introduce programming languages that are beneficial for the future of students like some other programming languages rather than qbasic.\n",
        " Offer more informative courses that align with the needs and interests of this generation.\"\n",
        " The curriculum needs more modern and practical lessons (QBASIC is not one of them) like teaching python, javascript, details on video and photo editing, etc which can give students a  headstart if they decide to involve in the related sectors. Things like history of computers, details on hardware, etc is not useful at all.\n",
        " Exercise should maintain in board exam format\n",

        " we should include video/photo editing and putting python in computer course in class 9 and 10 will be very bad because SEE pressure will be more and python should be in only in bacheleors level.\n",

AI is ruling the world at current so the students must be updated about all these technologies. Some projects also can be included regarding them, specially for IoT. Curriculum can include more real life examples to make students more clear..........\n",

I think the theoretical chapters that our book consists of are enough for our knowledge but as for the practical chapters, it doesn't suit the level of grades. For example, from classes 6 onwards the students should start learning the basics of coding and then slowly the level can be increased till grade 10. We can take our neighbouring country India as our example the students their learn coding from a very small age and have shown their skills of coding in different sectors. I personally think that later in future coding will help us too much and there are many fields within coding, which we can select and learn as our career option but we need to have some experiences from every fields of coding in order to select one and master in it.

Since computer technology  is developing day by day, teaching styles and materials should also be updated. Languages like python and java should also be taught in grade 9th.

Schools should embrace technology by allowing students to take laptops to school and encouraging practical projects that require online research and problem-solving. The curriculum should prioritize hands-on learning, enabling students to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.
